# Why-Parquet-in-Silver-Layer-


Using Parquet in the Silver layer of the Databricks medallion architecture offers key advantages for read-heavy, analytical workloads common in telecom analytics:

📊 Columnar Storage
Enables fast retrieval of specific columns — ideal for queries like:
"Average call drops per cell in Region X over last 30 days"

Reduces scan time by avoiding unnecessary column reads

📦 Efficient Compression
Telecom data (e.g., signal logs, CDRs) can be massive

Parquet’s built-in compression (Snappy, GZIP) drastically reduces storage size and I/O

🗂️ Partitioning Support
Native support for partitioning by high-cardinality fields (e.g., region, date)

Enables predicate pushdown: Databricks scans only relevant files → faster queries

🔁 Schema Evolution
Parquet metadata stores schema with the file

Works seamlessly with Databricks for managing gradual schema changes (e.g., adding device_type, call_type)

🧩 Interoperability
Open format compatible with Spark, Trino, Hive, Athena, and more

Supports cross-platform queries and ML training pipelines
